    1.  ## Objective

        [Patch management](https://www.kaseya.com/blog/2021/03/09/patch-management/) involves identifying, sourcing, testing, deploying and installing patches for all systems and applications in an organization. Patches are applied to improve the efficiency and functionality of a system as well as to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

        The policies define the steps, procedures and best practices to follow, especially when patching vulnerabilities that pose a security risk. The goal is to produce a standardized patching process so that technicians can make informed decisions during any stage of the patching process, including when correcting mistakes and handling contingencies.

    2.  ## Policy

        1.  Inventory of All IT assets should be maintained and updated regularly on Monthly basis.

        2.  Security Patches should be Applied on ALL Assets on a Regular basis as per timelines defined by the IT Security Team from Time to Time.

        3.  Wherever Possible Security Patches should first be Tested in a separate Test environment before applying them in Production environment.

        4.  Where Test Instances are not available, Security Patches can be applied to Production after seeking requisite Management approvals and following up necessary precautions as laid out by IT Security Team.

        5.  Record of Security Patching Activity Carried out should be maintained on Monthly Basis.

        6.  All Security Patching activities should be performed after seeking necessary Approvals and following the laid down process.

        7.  Wherever, it is not possible to Apply Security Patches for valid business reasons or any constraints, exceptions need to be taken and recorded for the period of Non-compliance.

        8.  All Infrastructure on Cloud, Laptops, Servers, Networking & Security Solutions, Business Applications subcomponents should follow regular Security Patches, whenever new Patches are released by the respective Vendors.

16. # Business Continuity Policy

    1.  ## Objective

        The primary goal continuity plan is to allow business operations to continue under emergency/disaster conditions, by introduction of appropriate strategies and recovery steps.

        The objectives of a business continuity plan (BCP) are to minimize financial loss, Reputation and Business to DER in event of a Disaster or Calamity. DER should be able continue to serve customers, mitigate the negative effects disruptions can have.

    2.  ## Policy

        1.  ### Emergency Response Plan

            2.  The Emergency Response Plan would be **reviewed and updated** at least Once every 12 months.

            3.  **List of Internal and External Stakeholders** will be maintained and updated who are part of the Emergency Response Team.

            4.  **Mock Drills** will be carried out at least Once every six months to Test the efficacy of the Emergency response plan.

                1.  **Tabletop Exercise Test** – The objective of this Scenario-based exercise, is to ensure all critical personnel in the organization are aware of and familiar with the relevant portions of the BCP, as well as their role in a disaster. A Tabletop exercise should be carried out every six months.

                2.  **Functional/Full Recovery Test **– A BCP Functional/Full Recovery Test involves a complete test of the Solution to for achievement of the recovery objectives. Full Recovery Test should be performed at least once in a year.

        2.  ### Business Impact Assessment

            Business Impact Assessment should be performed at least once in a year.

            Business impact analysis will identify different types of disasters that could disrupt DER business and quantify the impact of each scenario and should establish the RTO and RPO objectives.

            - **RTO** – The amount of time in which, following a serious event or outage, a business process and its associated applications must be restored to prevent a defined amount of impact.

            - **RPO** – The amount of data that could be manually recovered following the restoration of an application following a serious event or outage.

    2. ## Policy

       1. **A change approval Board (CAB)** will be constituted for approval of Changes to IT Systems who would assess the impact of the change and provide their approval. This includes both Operational and Project (newly introduced Service) Changes.

       2. **A workflow-based Change Approval process** “Request for Change (RFC) ” would be implemented, which will be a documented plan of the sequence or steps for implementing and releasing the change into the live environment.

       3. The RFC must also include **a rollback/mitigation plan** in case of failure.

       4. **A post-change test** being documented to check that the change has been successfully applied.

       5. **A Change Manager** would be nominated who would be responsible for ALL Changes in the DER environment.
